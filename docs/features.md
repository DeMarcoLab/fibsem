## Beam Current Alignment

The beam current alignment feature is a calibration tool to perform beam current alignment. It can be easily accessed and from the tools menu.

This will open a new window which will allow the user to align the currents to a reference.

To begin, the user must take images by clicking on the button labelled as "Take Images". This takes two images, one for the reference and one for aligning.

The images are labelled as reference and aligning which allows the user to visually comparing when aligning the beam. The reference and the aligning currents can be selected using the drop down available on the right.

To align the beam, the user must simply click on align beam. When alignment is done, a pop up window will reveal the shift needed to align the images

Clicking 'OK' will close the window and the user can continue to align the beam with other currents. Below the buttons there will be a list for reference which shows which currents have been aligned.

Clicking the "Overlay Images" checkbox will overlay the two images for comparison which provides another visual check for alignment.

Once the user is satisfied with the alignment, they can close the window and return back to the main OpenFIBSEM window. If necessary, this tool can be run again when required.
